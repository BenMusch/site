### What is CVHA?

CVHA (Cole Valley Haight Allies) is a group of neighbors in the Cole Valley and
Haight neighborhoods who support efforts to imrpove the lives of our unhoused
and low-income neighbors, such as the development of affordable housing, safe
sleeping sites and shelters.

### What is the Safe Sleeping site at 730 Stanyan? Where can I learn more about it?

Check out our [730 Stanyan FAQ page](/about-stanyan) for answers to all
questions about the site!

### Has the CVHA recommend boycotting local businesses?

No. The CVHA has not called for any boycotts nor signed on in support of any boycotts. There have been calls for boycotting some of the businesses involved by some in the neighborhood, but these calls did not come from CVHA, nor from its leadership. **CVHA urges people to take caution before calling for such a boycott.** Some businesses were not fully informed at first and have changed their stance towards the safe sleeping site. Additionally, at least one business was falsely attributed with an opinion on the safe sleeping site without their consent or knowledge.
