### What is CVHA?

CVHA (Cole Valley Haight Allies) is a group of neighbors in the Cole Valley and
Haight neighborhoods who support efforts to imrpove the lives of our unhoused
and low-income neighbors, such as the development of affordable housing, safe
sleeping sites and shelters.

### Does CVHA accept donations?

**In-kind donations:**

In general, the 730 Stanyan site accepts clean causl clothes, sneakers,
new/unused socks/underwear, and cloth masks. CVHA also generally accepts first
aid kits, baby wipes, packs of water bottles, gatorade, snack bars, dog food,
backpacks, suitcases, sleeping bags and tents. **Please do not show up at 730
Stanyan without clearing it with CVHA first.** You can do that by reaching out
over [email](mailto:ColeValleyHaightAllies@gmail.com).

**Monetary donations:**

Though we previously accepted money via PayPal to make grocery runs to
distribute to unhoused people in the neighborhood, we now only encourage
donations directly to other advocacy orgs. Some recommendations include
[Homeless Youth Alliance](https://homelessyouthalliance.networkforgood.com/projects/91439-donate-to-homeless-youth-alliance)
(the operators of CAMP) or [Coalition on Homelessness](https://www.cohsf.org/get-involved/ways-to-give/).
We also encourage you to donate to [SF Neighbors Solidarity Fund](https://twitter.com/Solidarity_SF),
[SF Community Fridge](https://www.gofundme.com/f/san-francisco-community-fridge-fund?utm_source=customer&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet&utm_medium=copy_link-tip), [Street Medic Couper](https://gf.me/u/yjwkbz), and
[DSA SF’s #HotelsNotHospitals Fund](https://gf.me/u/yuh2cq).

### Can I volunteer with CVHA?

We help with a handful of initiatives which can use volunteers:

 - CVHA volunteers deliver hot meals to unhoused San Franciscans every night.
 We currently have people scheduled for each day of the week, but are always in
 need of people to fill-in when others cannot make it. The meals are picked up
 at 730 Stanyan at 5:30pm. To sign up, [email us](mailto:ColeValleyHaightAllies@gmail.com).
 - CVHA is currently partnering with a mutual aid coalition of groups called the
 Common Humanity Collective to manufacture and distribute FREE hand sanitizer,
 face masks, and disinfectant wipes for unhoused people in San Francisco. With
 the help of Supervisor Preston’s staff, CHC is running a D5 operation out of
 Redemption Church on Divisadero & McAllister. If you’re interested in getting
 involved, [email us](mailto:ColeValleyHaightAllies@gmail.com). More info [here](bit.ly/mutual-aid-hand-sanitizer)
 - CVHA volunteers prepare and deliver a home cooked dinner to 730 Stanyan every
 other Tuesday. To join the 730 Feast Team, [email us](mailto:ColeValleyHaightAllies@gmail.com).
 Feel free to also email us if you’re interested in contributing funds or
 ingredients towards these dinners.
 - CVHA volunteers buy and drop off groceries to our unhoused neighbors every weekend.
 If you’re interested in handling a grocery run and/or donating groceries,
 [email us](mailto:ColeValleyHaightAllies@gmail.com).


### What is the Safe Sleeping site at 730 Stanyan? Why does CVHA support it?

Check out our [730 Stanyan FAQ page](/about/730) for answers to all
questions about the site!

### Has the CVHA recommend boycotting local businesses?

No. The CVHA has not called for any boycotts nor signed on in support of any boycotts. There have been calls for boycotting some of the businesses involved by some in the neighborhood, but these calls did not come from CVHA, nor from its leadership. **CVHA urges people to take caution before calling for such a boycott.** Some businesses were not fully informed at first and have changed their stance towards the safe sleeping site. Additionally, at least one business was falsely attributed with an opinion on the safe sleeping site without their consent or knowledge.
