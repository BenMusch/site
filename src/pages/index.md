subheading: Residents of Cole Valley and Haight supporting our low-income and
  unhoused neighbors
description: We are Cole Valley and Haight residents and business owners who
  advocate for our unhoused neighbors. We are in support of low-income housing
  and other initiatives that address income inequality in San Francisco. In
  particular, we support the Safe Sleeping site at 730 Stanyan. Our goal is to
  have a neighborhood that is safe and humane for all its residents, housed and
  unhoused.
