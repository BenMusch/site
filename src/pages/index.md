subheading: Residents of Cole Valley and Haight supporting a just and equitable
  neighborhood for all neighbors.
description: We are Cole Valley and Haight residents and business owners who
  advocate for an equitable neighborhood for all. We are in support of
  low-income housing and other initiatives that address income inequality in San
  Francisco. We initially coalesced around supporting the Safe Sleeping site at
  730 Stanyan. Our broader goal is to have a neighborhood that is safe and
  humane for all residents, housed and unhoused.

      heading: Systemic Change
      text: We support policies that divest from the policing of unhoused residents
        and invest in sustainable solutions that seek to address the systemic
        neglect and oppression of unhoused residents throughout San Francisco.
